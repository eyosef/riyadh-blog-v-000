      <p>Once a mudbrick waystation along desert trading routes, Riyadh is now one
      of the wealthiest cities in the world. The country’s political, financial and
      administrative capital is also a city with a fascinating subtext.</p>

      <h4>History</h4>

      <p>Riyadh (/rɨˈjɑːd/; Arabic: الرياض‎ ar-Riyāḍ pronounced [arːiˈjɑːdˤ],"The
      Gardens") is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. It is also the
      capital of Riyadh Province, and belongs to the historical regions of Najd and
      Al-Yamama. It is situated in the center of the Arabian Peninsula on a large
      plateau, and is home to 5,254,560 people, and the urban center of a region
      with a population of close to 7 million people.</p>
